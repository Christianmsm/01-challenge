## Description

What I did was refactored the code to meet the Acceptance Criteria. 

What I did first was gave it a title then I worked on giving the source
code semantic HTML elements. I also made the HTML code easier to read by adding spacing between different section, as well as putting the information in the "p" elements into an easier to read format.

Next I added alt text to the images in the code. 

I then started working on the CSS stylesheet, in the stylesheet I consolidated certain classes that had the same style attributes into one specific class. 

I then adjusted the font size for the "p" elements as well as for the main logo for the business. I then added my own custom color palette through the page.

This assignment challenged me to really look line by line to find the things that were missing and what could be changed to clean the code up and make it function much better that previously.

## Credits

For this assignment I also refered to W3 schools for help with semantic HTML elements.
